    rules:
      - name: "foregroundColor to foregroundStyle"

        replacement: "foregroundStyle()"
      
      - name: "cornerRadius to clipShape"
        description: "Replace cornerRadius() with clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:)). The latter offers more advanced features such as uneven rounded rectangles."
        pattern: "cornerRadius()"
        replacement: "clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:))"
      
      - name: "onChange modifier parameters"
        description: "The onChange() modifier should not be used in its 1-parameter variant. Either accept two parameters or none, but the old variant is unsafe and deprecated."
        pattern: "onChange(\\s*\\{[^}]+\\})"
        replacement: "Use onChange with two parameters or none"
      
      - name: "tabItem to Tab API"
        description: "Replace old tabItem() modifier with the new Tab API. This provides type-safe tab selection and supports iOS 26 search tab design."
        pattern: "tabItem()"
        replacement: "New Tab API"
      
      - name: "NavigationView to NavigationStack"
        description: "Replace NavigationView with NavigationStack. Only stay with NavigationView if you still need to support iOS 15."

    rules:
      - name: "onTapGesture to Button"
        description: "Replace almost all use of onTapGesture() with an actual button. Only exceptions are where you need to know a tap's location or the number of taps. This is significantly better for VoiceOver and eye tracking on visionOS."
        pattern: "onTapGesture()"
        replacement: "Button with proper action"
        exceptions:
          - "When tap location is needed"
          - "When number of taps is needed"

      - name: "Button label API"
        description: "Watch out for button labels being made with Label rather than the newer, inline API (Button(\"Tap me\", systemImage: \"plus\", action: whatever)), or worse, with just an image. This is a real problem for VoiceOver users."

    rules:

      - name: "Computed properties to separate views"
        description: "If code breaks up views by placing things into computed properties, split them out into separate SwiftUI views instead. This is important for performance when using @Observable – computed properties do not benefit from the intelligent view invalidation of @Observable."

    rules:
      - name: "Dynamic Type fonts"
        description: "Some LLMs (particularly Claude) love to force specific font sizes – search for .font(.system(size: and replace as many of them as you can using Dynamic Type fonts. If you can support iOS 26 or later, you can also use .font(.body.scaled(by: 1.5)) and similar."
        pattern: "\\.font\\(\\.system\\(size:"
        replacement: "Dynamic Type fonts (.body, .title, etc.) or .font(.body.scaled(by: ...)) for iOS 26+"

      - name: "ForEach enumeration"
        description: "Replace code like ForEach(Array(x.enumerated()), id: \\.element.id) with ForEach(x.enumerated(), id: \\.element.id) – we don't need the Array initializer."

    rules:
      - name: "DispatchQueue.main.async avoidance"
